# AI Based Disaster Relief and Management System

üîç Summary of DRAMS (Disaster Relief and Management System)
DRAMS is an AI-powered decision support system designed to optimize disaster response operations during all phases of a natural calamity:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Disaster (Detection & Prediction)

Uses Deep Learning (CNNs) and CCTV footage to detect disasters in real-time.
Predicts evacuation zones based on impact estimates & population clusters.
2Ô∏è‚É£ During Disaster (Alert & Rescue Operations)

Sends real-time alerts to affected users via Aadhaar, PAN & Aarogya Setu.
Uses DBSCAN clustering to identify high-distress areas.
Computes optimal rescue routes using GRASP & VND algorithms.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Disaster (Relief & Recovery)

Restores connectivity by planning road reconstruction based on real-time data.
Deploys relief vehicles efficiently using AI-based routing algorithms.
üöÄ Key Technologies Used:
‚úÖ Deep Learning (CNNs, VGG-16) for disaster detection.
‚úÖ DBSCAN clustering for identifying high-risk zones.
‚úÖ GRASP & VND routing algorithms for optimized vehicle deployment.
‚úÖ Kubernetes & Django for scalable system deployment.

üåç Real-World Use Cases:
‚úîÔ∏è Flash Floods ‚Äì Real-time tracking & evacuation planning.
‚úîÔ∏è COVID-19 Prevention ‚Äì Crowd detection & social distancing enforcement.
‚úîÔ∏è City Fires ‚Äì Automated alerts & rescue coordination.

## City-Fire Detector
Download the fire.model from the above drive link and add it in the output folder. \
To check its working run the predict_fire.py from command line with the required arguments ( Commented at the beginning of the .py file ). \
Input video can be taken from the videos folder by videos/( any fire video.mp4).


## Flood-Detector
Download the flood.model from the above drive link and add it in the output folder. \
To check its working run the predict_flood.py from command line with the required arguments ( Commented at the beginning of the .py file ). \
Input video can be taken from the videos folder by videos/(any flood video.mp4).

## Social-Distance-Detector
Copy the yolov3.weights file from the above drive link and paste in Social-Disatance-Detector/yolo-coco/ \
For Using GPU - Go to Social-Disatance-Detector/utils/social_distancing_config.py and change USE_GPU to True
Run the social_distance_detector.py from command line with the required arguments ( Commented at begining of .py file)
